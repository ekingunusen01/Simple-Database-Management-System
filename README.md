# Simple-Database-Management-System

This is a text-based database management system application using C++ with a custom doubly linked list data structure which stores and manages person data (name, age). User can perform simple CRUD(create, read, update, delete) operations and sorting records based on age and name. Application reads data from the file named input.txt, writes back the list in an ascending order by age to the file age.txt and by name to the file name.txt.
